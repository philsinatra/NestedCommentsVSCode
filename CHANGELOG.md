### 🎉 The [Scott Rhamy](https://github.com/cycle4passion) update!

A big thank you to [Scott Rhamy](https://github.com/cycle4passion) for this major update that finally brings support to Svelte/Vue.

- Add support for `*.js` and `*.ts` files
- Add support for multiple cursor selections
- Add Svelte/Vue support
- Fix Selection after commenting to include the initial block comment indicator.
- Fix Selection starting with a block comment indicator and having an ending block comment indicator in middle with additional text selected. It would uncomment rather than comment.

- 🚀 Laverdet Update

Special thanks to [laverdet](https://github.com/laverdet) for a major update, which includes:

- support for additional languages (full list of supported languages is available in the README file)
- flexible selections: selections don't need to be exact, so if you want to uncomment a block and your selection is off by just whitespace you can still activate the command
- partial uncommenting: if you make a selection within a larger comment block and activate the command you can uncomment just a subset of the larger block
