- 🚀 Laverdet Update

Special thanks to [laverdet](https://github.com/laverdet) for a major update, which includes:

- support for additional languages (full list of supported languages is available in the README file)
- flexible selections: selections don't need to be exact, so if you want to uncomment a block and your selection is off by just whitespace you can still activate the command
- partial uncommenting: if you make a selection within a larger comment block and activate the command you can uncomment just a subset of the larger block
